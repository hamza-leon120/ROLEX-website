This project is a fully responsive website developed using Pug (template engine), SCSS (modular styling), and vanilla JavaScript. The code follows clean architecture principles, using mixins, variables, and reusable UI components. It includes custom animations, responsive layout adjustments, and a dynamic theme-switching system.
